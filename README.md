# Back & Forth README

This small extension for VSCode adds go back/forward buttons to the title bar for easier navigation through recent files. Just like arrows in any web browser

They do the same as these default shortcuts:

- Go back: `Ctrl + Alt + -` (Mac: `⌃-`)
- Go forward: `Ctrl + Shift + -` (Mac: `⌃⇧-`)
